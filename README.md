# ksh-env
Suite of ksh functions
======================
These shell functions provide additional facilities at the command line to the standard shell environment. 
They were written the then Korn shell in the late 1990s mainly on AIX, HP-UX and Solaris.  They were designed to work across the many
unix/linux systems I administered at that time. 

You get hooked on your shell environment, so I still use them in 2022, though now mainly in as zsh/Macs, or bash/Linux. 
There is very little difference, from a scripting viewpoint, between the main interactive shells, viz. sh, bash, ksh, zsh.  
I try to accomodate those differences to they work under all these shells.
